This statement applies to the Layers of Vision site (https://layersofvision.org/).

This website is run by [King's Digital Lab, King's College London (KDL)](https://kdl.kcl.ac.uk) in collaboration with the [King's Business School](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/business). We want as many people as possible to be able to use this website. For example, that means you should be able to:

- zoom in up to 300% without the text spilling off the screen
- navigate most of the website using just a keyboard
- listen to most of the website using a screen reader (including the most recent versions of JAWS, NVDA and VoiceOver)

Weâ€™ve also made the website text as simple as possible to understand.

[AbilityNet](https://mcmw.abilitynet.org.uk/) has advice on making your device easier to use if you have a disability.
