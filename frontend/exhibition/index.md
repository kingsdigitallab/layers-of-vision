Layers of Vision is an art exhibition that explores the experiences and perspectives of blind and partially sighted (BPS) artists living in a world made for sighted people. In meaningfully co-created and joyful ways, Layers of Vision raises attention to, and challenges, the barriers that people who are blind or have sight loss are facing in everyday life. It does so by
exhibiting ten artworks that celebrate and creatively explore accessibility.

Each artwork, in its own way, appreciates different forms of vision and features multisensory elements to foster engagement, stimulate discussions, and question common views and practices around access and disability inclusion in the arts and beyond.
