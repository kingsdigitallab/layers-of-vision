altText: This image shows a 3D sculpture surrounded by a steel frame. The sculpture shows three sculptures. The furthest away sculpture shows David using his cane as he passes a chair with a red hat positioned on its corner. The middle sculpture shows David sitting on a chair with the red hat on his head. The final and closest sculptural scene shows a mirroring of the first sculpture of David using his cane and now passed the chair with the red hat positioned on its corner. In the background of the image are students and persons congregating in the social gallery area.
