workTitle: Inner
year: 2022
workType: Live performance and interactive collage on canvas.
workSize: N/A
workDescription: Inner is an interactive collage that is born during the artist’s opening night live performance, and continues to grow through contributions of visitors throughout the exhibition run. The performance is underpinned by a dynamic sound score using paint, materials, and sensory exploration to evoke unique storytelling, and to push creative integrated access across artistic forms. It raises attention to the experience of being overlooked, underrepresented, and easily stereotyped, yet results in a beautiful collaborative collage, uniting us with the shared experience of humanity.

Alice Christina-Corrigan is a visually impaired and neurodiverse artist. Her work combines sensory exploration with technological devices to evoke a unique and vibrant way of incorporating creative access into art.

Alice radically, creatively and dynamically questions the technological world of creative access in art. ‘Inner’ is her first live art piece which has given her an opportunity to bring to light issues she feels passionate about whilst also creating something with the community itself. Her work has been supported by Graeae, Extant theatre, Octagon Theatre ACE England, CRIPTIC and performed at Barbican Centre and Camden People’s Theatre and The Lowry.
