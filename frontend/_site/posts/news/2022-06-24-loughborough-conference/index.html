  Cordelia Beattie (PI), Suzanne Trill (Co-I) and Sharon Howard (PDRA) will be
  speaking at 'How to do things with early modern words' at the University of
  Loughborough on 15 July 2022.

  2021 saw the publication of the first volume of
  <em>The Cambridge Edition of the Works of Aphra Behn</em>. Editing Behn’s
  remarkable oeuvre has involved an international team of scholars, drawing on
  expertise from across the humanities. ‘How to do things with early modern
  words’ marks the 350th anniversary of the start of Behn’s career, and aims to
  celebrate and develop interdisciplinary approaches to early modern studies.
  Bringing together researchers working in literature, digital humanities,
  history, theatre history, and language in the 1500-1750 period, the conference
  will explore cutting-edge themes, perspectives and approaches in scholarship
  on the early modern world.

  We will speak on our progress to date towards a digital edition of the four
  manuscript books of Alice Thornton. At this point in the project, we are
  focusing on why Thornton wrote four different autobiographical volumes and how
  they relate to each other. It is already clear that their contents raise
  questions about both the composition process and their intended audiences. To
  begin the process of addressing these questions, we have transcribed all four
  manuscripts, and begun the process of editing them and tagging them so that
  users could read them continuously as single volumes, side-by-side in
  semi-diplomatic transcription and modernised form, and/or compare variant
  accounts of the same events. Our panel will explore the practical and
  technical issues involved in the project and invite feedback from potential
  users of the digital edition.
