          <p>This statement applies to the My Default Site site (<a href="https://thornton.kdl.kcl.ac.uk/">https://thornton.kdl.kcl.ac.uk/</a>).</p>
<p>This website is run by <a href="https://kdl.kcl.ac.uk">King's Digital Lab, King's College London (KDL)</a> in collaboration with the <a href="https://www.ed.ac.uk/">University of Edinburgh</a>. We want as many people as possible to be able to use this website. For example, that means you should be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>zoom in up to 300% without the text spilling off the screen</li>
<li>navigate most of the website using just a keyboard</li>
<li>listen to most of the website using a screen reader (including the most recent versions of JAWS, NVDA and VoiceOver)</li>
</ul>
<p>We’ve also made the website text as simple as possible to understand.</p>
<p><a href="https://mcmw.abilitynet.org.uk/">AbilityNet</a> has advice on making your device easier to use if you have a disability.</p>
<h2><a id="how"></a>How accessible this website is</h2>
<p>We know some part of this website are not fully accessible:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dynamic content is handled with <a href="https://vuejs.org/">VueJS</a> and we are aware that the rendered HTML includes custom tags that don't pass the <a href="https://validator.w3.org/">W3 Validator</a>. This may interfere with assistive technologies. We are still in the process of assessing the site and plan to ensure all important content, if not all, is accessible.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Reporting accessibility problems with this website</h2>
<p>Please email <a href="mailto:Jo.Edge@ed.ac.uk">Jo.Edge@ed.ac.uk</a> with details of the problems.</p>
<h2>Compliance status</h2>
<p>This website is partially compliant with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.1 AA standard, due to the non-compliances listed above and the work in progress still happening on the site.</p>
<h2>What we’re doing to improve accessibility</h2>
<p>KDL looking at fixes and alternatives to the issues listed in the &quot;<a href="#how">How accessible this website is</a>&quot; section.
In particular we plan to fix the images issue by the end of October 2022.</p>
